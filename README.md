# Music Emotion Recognition using CNNs

This project predicts emotional dimensions (valence & arousal) from music audio
using mel-spectrograms and deep convolutional neural networks.

## Dataset
- DEAM (Database for Emotional Analysis of Music)

## Pipeline
- Audio → Mel Spectrogram
- CNN-based feature extraction
- Emotion classification (Happy / Sad / Angry / Relaxed)

## Tech Stack
- PyTorch
- Librosa
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Future Work
- CNN + RNN temporal modeling
- Continuous valence-arousal regression
- Attention-based pooling
